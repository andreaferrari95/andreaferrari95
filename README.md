ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrea Ferrari
 Front-End & E-commerce Developer â€” React | TypeScript | UX 

- I'm a developer passionate about clean code, intuitive interfaces, and meaningful digital experiences. My main tools include React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Hero UI â€” all used to craft responsive, high-performance applications.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working at Phonetastik GmbH, where I develop and maintain e-commerce platforms with a strong focus on performance and scalability.

ðŸ§  I recently completed a climate dashboard project called GreenPulse, which visualizes global warming data using live APIs, mobile-first responsive charts, and dynamic data rendering (e.g. switching from line to bar charts on mobile).

ðŸš€ I'm currently expanding my skills into Full Stack and WordPress development to tackle a wider range of projects independently.

I love working on projects that inform, empower, and make the web a better place.
